# openhaystack-esp32

Modified version of Openhaystack firmware for ESP-IDF v5.3

Obviously, I have made modifications for it to build on my ESP32C6, since apparently other firmwares only gave prebuilt binaries for the ESP32.

I'm 99.99% sure you can change the board if you're going to compile from the ESP-IDF command line or whatever

## Installation

You're going to need to generate a `.bin` file from the code here for your board. Follow the rest of the installation of Openhaystack like normal.
